**_Template pattern_**
In Template pattern, an abstract class exposes defined way(s)/template(s) to execute its methods.
Its subclasses can overrides the method implementations as per need basis but the invocation is to
be in the same way as defined by an abstract class. This pattern comes under behavior pattern
category.
